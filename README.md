# Dodge-Oka
Remember the game Space Invaders we played when we were young? Spending hours on that pixelated screen, dodging lasers and getting frustrated at the difficult levels. Who would’ve thought that we would reach a stage in life where life starts to imitate the game, and we are the spaceship being bombarded with lasers (responsibilities). As we all know, Term 4 is pretty tough, and the school ‘shoots’ lots of homework, projects, and fifth-row commitments at us. But as young aspiring engineers, we must be able to think and move fast before all these tasks destroy us. In this game, Dodge Oka, users can experience dodging all the responsibilities the school shoots at us. However, the Professors notice when we manage to survive, and the speed at which assignments are thrown at us increases. Nevertheless, we must persevere and continue dodging all these ‘lasers’ and aim to survive the term. We only have three lives, each one precious and needful for us to tide this battle. We wish you all the best, and don‘t get destroyed by Term 4.
